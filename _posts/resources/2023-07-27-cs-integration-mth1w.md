When the Ontario government launched the [new grade 9 math curriculum in 2021](https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/secondary-mathematics/courses/mth1w/strands), it included expectations that would connect coding and computer science to mathematics. Many have taken the approach of using a block-based style of coding like Scratch, which has some limitations.

Python is a beginner-friendly programming language that can be very powerful for automating some of the more "tedious" tasks that we often teach grade 9 students, like using a left side/right side chart to check their solution to a linear equation for example. We can actually write some code that would do that for us. It can be used to automate the calculation of how long it will take for a savings goal to be met, calculate some basic statistics like mean and median, and much more.

In partnership with Cybera and Callysto, [ACSE](https://acse.net/) created some classroom-ready resources specifically for grade 9 math (and science!) students that make use of Python and Jupyter notebooks (or Google Colab). Those resources can be found over at the [CS Integration](https://csintegration.ca/resources/) site.
