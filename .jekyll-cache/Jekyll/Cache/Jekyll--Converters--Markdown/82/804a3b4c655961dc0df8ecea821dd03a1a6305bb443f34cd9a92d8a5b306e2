<p>Hi! I’m Emily. I’m an educator in Toronto, Canada.</p>

<p>As a teacher, I’m focused on strengthening my students’ competencies in critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication, especially with technology. I believe that digital literacy and technical fluency can strengthen my students’ ability to solve problems creatively and think critically in a global context.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a student at <span class="about links"><a href="https://queensu.ca">Queen’s University</a></span> where I completed a Bachelor of Computing (Hons) in Computing &amp; Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in History. I also attended Queen’s for my Bachelor of Education. I received the <span class="about links"><a href="https://www.cs.queensu.ca/aboutus/awards/awards.php?type=internal">Queen’s School of Computing’s Student Distinguished Service Award</a></span> in 2018 for being heavily involved in orientation week, student government, and as a teaching assistant during my time there.</p>
