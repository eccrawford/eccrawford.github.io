Hi! I'm Emily. I'm an educator in Toronto, Canada.

As a teacher, I'm focused on strengthening my students’ competencies in critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication, especially with technology. I believe that digital literacy and technical fluency can strengthen my students’ ability to solve problems creatively and think critically in a global context. 



Previously, I was a student at <span class="about links">[Queen's University](https://queensu.ca)</span> where I completed a Bachelor of Computing (Hons) in Computing & Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in History. I also attended Queen's for my Bachelor of Education. I received the <span class="about links">[Queen's School of Computing's Student Distinguished Service Award](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/news/2018/05/30/tenth-annual-school-of-computing-awards/)</span> in 2018 for being heavily involved in orientation week, student government, and as a teaching assistant during my time there.
